Okay, this was part-way through the process of doing the treelist conversion to <vector>,
but handling the recursion in display_dir_tree() is very complex,
so I'm going to drop the conversion for now...

This project is saved in ndir32.re-tree folder

Maybe try implementing on read_tree project first.
